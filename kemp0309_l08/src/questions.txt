----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: Which of these three is the most inefficient tree? Why? 

A: Data1 and Data2 is the least effucicient level due to the fact that they have the most amount of levels causing the program
    to slow down

Q: Which of these is likely to be the most efficient tree?

A: Data3 is the most effiecent structure due to the fact that it has the least amount of levels, 
   This means that the program has less processing to do increasing efficiency 

Q: How could you (theoretically) figure that out?

A: Drawing out trees/printing to console will let us visualize efficient routes
